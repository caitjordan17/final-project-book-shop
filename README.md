# BookLiker

BookLiker is a book app where you can add and like books in your own personal library!

## Keep track!

Keep track of which books you liked & how much you liked them by upping the likes under the book!

## How it works:

- Add a new book with the "New Book" tab
- When you read it, like the book
- Each time you think about the book, like the book
- See which books you liked the most!

## Info:

The BookLiker App is an online application and is open 24hrs, 7 days a week.

## Best Practices:
- Pick a high resolution image for the New Book URL
- Write Author names how you would see it on the cover of the book
    - ie: "Madeline Miller" instead of "Miller, Madeline"
- Keep the subtitles off the Title form, otherwise it gets a bit clunky
- Have fun & like away!
